# Contributing
First off again, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute the starter for your tutorial.

Here is why Quicksi is great for your tutorial starters.

- You save time. Your listeners or students don't need to go to your Github repo, click the clone button, copy the link, open up terminal, paste the link, clone, wait and then install the packages if need be and wait too. Of course you might not wait for everyone to clone and install dependencies before you continue your talk or tutorial. And so while you start giving your hard prepared presentations, others will miss because they're still battling with setting up.

- Quicksi solves that, all they need is run quicksi command on their terminal, choose tutorial, paste the number you created your quicksi as and boom! Quicksi generates the starter and install the dependencies, all they need is `cd` into the project and start working. In any process, quicksi breaks the time.

## Tips to adding your starter
- Adding your starter. There will be a lot of starters, to make starter more accessible, you're naming your starter with a number, no more or less than 3.
- Documenting your starter on the web. On the web documentation, under `tutorial`, you're creating a new `md` doc using either your name, or the name of your organization as the title, inside the docs you're documentation all your starters.
