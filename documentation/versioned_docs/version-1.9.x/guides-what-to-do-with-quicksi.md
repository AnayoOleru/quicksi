## Tutorials
During local or online live workshop conferences, points are been missed by listeners or the audience because can't wait for all to setup. With quicksi, your listeners or students don't need to go to your Github repo, click the clone button, copy the link, open up terminal, paste the link, run the clone command, wait, install the dependencies, wait.

Quicksi generates the starter and install the dependencies, all they need is `cd` into the project and start working. In any process, quicksi breaks the time.
